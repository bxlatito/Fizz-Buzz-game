In this fast-paced game, you’ll face a series of numbers each round, each number (starting from 1) will be displayed in the black dislay box below and your job is to choose the correct button before the time runs out! <br>

Each round, you’ll see a number in the display box. You must quickly decide which of the four buttons to click based on the number’s divisibility: <br>



<span class="header">Button Options</span>:<br>
	•	<span class="heading">Normal</span>
Select this if the number is NOT divisible by 3 or 5. <br>
	•	<span class="heading">Fizz</span>
Select this if the number is divisible by 3 but not by 5.<br>
	•	<span class="heading">Buzz</span>
Select this if the number is divisible by 5 but not by 3.<br>
	•	<span class="heading">Fizz Buzz</span>
Select this if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.<br>



<span class="header">Time Limit:</span> <br>

You only have a short time to choose your answer each round. Be fast and accurate — wrong answers or timeouts end the game!</p>
